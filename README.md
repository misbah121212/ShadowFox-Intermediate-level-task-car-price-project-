# 🚗 Car Price Prediction App

A **Machine Learning and Streamlit** based web application that predicts the **selling price of a car** based on various features such as year, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, and transmission type.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project uses a **Random Forest Regression Model** trained on historical car data to estimate the selling price of used cars.  
The app provides an easy-to-use **Streamlit web interface** where users can enter car details and get an instant price prediction.

---

## 🧠 Features

✅ Predicts used car prices with machine learning  
✅ Interactive UI built with **Streamlit**  
✅ Handles categorical & numerical preprocessing automatically  
✅ Visualizes user inputs and prediction  
✅ Ready for deployment on Streamlit Cloud

## 📊 Dataset

- **File:** `data.csv`
- **Description:** Contains various car attributes used to train the model.
- **Columns include:**
  - `Year` — Year of manufacture  
  - `Kms_Driven` — Total kilometers driven  
  - `Fuel_Type` — Petrol / Diesel / CNG  
  - `Seller_Type` — Dealer / Individual  
  - `Transmission` — Manual / Automatic  
  - `Present_Price` — Current showroom price (in lakhs)  
  - `Owner` — Number of previous owners

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Converts categorical features into numeric form  
   - Applies log transformation to `Kms_Driven`  
   - Calculates `car_age` using the current year

2. **Model Training**  
   - A **RandomForestRegressor** model is trained on processed data  
   - The model is serialized and saved as `model.pkl`

3. **Prediction**  
   - User inputs are collected via Streamlit  
   - The same preprocessing steps are applied  
   - The trained model predicts the selling price instantly

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/car-price-project.git
cd car-price-project

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Train the Model (if not already trained)
python train_model.py


This will create a file called model.pkl in your folder.

4️⃣ Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run app.py


Once it starts, open your browser at http://localhost:8501

You’ll see a web interface where you can enter car details and get a predicted price.

🌐 Deployment (Optional)

You can deploy your Streamlit app online for free:

Go to https://share.streamlit.io

Log in with GitHub

Click “New App”

Select this repository

Choose:
